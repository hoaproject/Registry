Hoa is a **modular**, **extensible** and **structured** set of PHP libraries.
Moreover, Hoa aims at being a bridge between industrial and research worlds.

# Hoa\Registry ![state](http://central.hoa-project.net/State/Registry)

This library offers a static registry that stores key/value combinations. Any kind of PHP variable can be stored: an array, an object, a resource, etc..

## Quick usage

As a quick example, we set an entry and retrieve it. The retrieval can be done with a static method on the `Hoa\Registry\Registry` class and also using the `hoa://` protocol.

```php
Hoa\Register\Registry::set('foo', 'bar');
var_dump(
    Hoa\Registry\Registry::get('foo'),
    resolve('hoa://Library/Registry#foo')
);

/**
 * Will output:
 *     string(3) "bar"
 *     string(3) "bar"
 */
```
